          <h2>
            We never thought a simple quiz would send us on this journey!
          </h2>
          <p>
            You know those moments in life where you look back to a certain
            decision…
          </p>
          <p>
            A decision that’s lead you down the path to where you are now, good
            or bad?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well I thought they’d always be from bigger things like getting a
            new job, getting married or winning the lottery… not from a simple
            quiz lol!
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, I will let you know I was never the “thin attractive” one
            in my group of friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            More likely the one that gets invited to be the bridesmaid to make
            the bride look better!
          </p>
          <p>
            And my husband, well I’d be rich if I got paid every time he used
            the excuse “I’m big boned”.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we’ve both struggled trying to keep the pounds off our entire
            lives, I don’t know how we let it get so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            This stopped us ever meeting up with friends because we dreaded
            eating in front of other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlotte and John had always struggled with their weight too, so if
            we’d have known how much they had changed, we wouldn’t have agreed
            to meet them.
          </p>
          <p>Now that would have been a huge mistake!</p>
          <p>
            It’s funny when we look back, we didn’t dare go out and have nice
            meals because we were worried about all the calories and what people
            would think of us…
          </p>
          <p>
            But we never batted an eyelid at the takeouts we ordered every
            Friday night and the snacks we had most evenings!
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s just when I had to get ready to go meet other people, I looked
            in the mirror and hated it.
          </p>
          <div class="inner-image">
            <img src="../images/Women-in-Mirror.jpg" alt="women in mirror" />
          </div>
          <p>
            But I never knew why because we’d earnt all the treats we could
            devour right?!?
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what I think our minds kept telling us after going out for
            walks, the odd run, spin classes and we even had a gym membership!
          </p>
          <p>But our bodies never seemed to agree.</p>
          <p>
            They say once you start exercising it becomes a habit and you
            actually enjoy it.
          </p>
          <p>Not for us!</p>
          <p>
            We never enjoyed being drenched in sweat, tired and achy when we
            could be sat at home with a good bottle of wine and our favorite TV
            show!

            I tried blaming the baby weight I gained, even though that’s only a
            small part of it, everything does seem 10 times harder after having
            a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I think my husband put on “sympathy weight” while I was
            pregnant.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how much effort we put in, the scales only ever seem to go
            in one direction ⬆️
          </p>
          <p>
            And the truth is, we were super skeptical and the only reason we
            listened to Charlotte and John was because we knew how much they had
            struggled with their weight in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn’t help showing how angry I was at all the doctors with
            their diet and exercise plans that never worked!
          </p>
          <p>But they understood, they knew exactly what we were thinking...</p>
          <p>“We’re going to be overweight for life”</p>
          <p>
            This is what led them to reveal how one night Charlotte was
            scrolling Facebook and came across a post talking about this unusual
            'After Dinner Ritual”'.
          </p>
          <p>
            All she did was click the link, took a simple quiz, and found out
            that it could work for her too!
          </p>
          <p>
            She first shared this “strange ritual” with her husband, and now
            with us!
          </p>
          <div class="inner-image">
            <img src="../images/Resurge-image-D5.jpg" alt="img" />
          </div>
          <p>
            And it turns out taking this quick quiz was the pivotal moment that
            has completely transformed ours lives too…
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of feeling hopeless, failing diets and hours of grueling
            exercise... once we started implementing this 2 minute after dinner
            ritual the weight began to melt away overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            We now love going out with friends because they are the ones asking
            us what has changed!
          </p>
          <p>(and we love sharing it)</p>
          <p>
            We also found out that it reverses the debilitating symptoms of
            heart disease, diabetes and all signs of ageing 😲
          </p>
          <p>For years we were told:</p>
          <div class="list">
            <p>🚩Diets help you lose weight</p>
            <p>🚩Exercise helps you lose weight</p>
            <p>🚩Our genetics are the issue!</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            They want you to believe this, that you’re broken, that it’s your
            fault.
          </p>
          <p>But it’s not your fault!</p>
          <p>
            Which is why we can now safely say taking this quiz changed our
            lives!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our old friends knew we weren’t the type of people to take quizzes
            or questionnaires online…
          </p>
          <p>
            But we’re eternally grateful to them because it was exactly what our
            bodies and we needed.
          </p>
          <p>Yep… our new life journey all started with this quiz.</p>
          <p>
            Hell, if it had been the usual 20 minute questionnaires you get
            pushed into doing, I don’t think we would have even bothered!
          </p>
          <p>
            But knowing what we do now, we’d easily give 2 hours never mind 20
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news... now it’s your turn and the quiz only takes 30
            seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            BUT the thing is, it won't work for everybody. In fact, it's
            probably a waste of time for anybody under 40.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the rest of us who could use a little helping hand... I
            recommend you scroll up now and answer the 4 quick questions.
