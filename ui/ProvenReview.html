            The weight loss market is huge right now, with new brands being
            introduced all the time. However, picking your way through these
            brands can be a difficult task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many brands overblow their claims, promising results that they
            cannot deliver to customers. Some others will try to achieve fast
            results through dangerous ingredients, without openly disclosing
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help you decide if ProVen is the right brand for you, we’ve
            compiled an overview of the company:

          <ul class="second">
            <li>
              ProVen supplements are made of 100% natural ingredients
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It means there are no harmful toxins that will be introduced

                <li>
                  ProVen focuses on a clean, healthy approach to weight loss.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              ProVen does not include ingredients meant to induce a laxative
              effect.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some weight loss supplements contain ingredients that work as
                  laxatives to stimulate weight loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can have serious and dangerous side effects and is an
                  unhealthy and unsustainable way of losing weight.

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              ProVen does not make outlandish claims about dramatic overnight
              weight loss.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some weight loss companies claim that you can see dramatic
                  weight loss in only a few weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should be very cautious with claims like these because
                  often they claim you can lose dangerous amounts of weight in a
                  short space of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weight-loss like this is unsustainable! You should be focusing
                  on the long term, sustainable changes over time, which will
                  take months.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Cons:</h2>
          <ul class="second">
            <li>
              ProVen has not been tested by a third-party company.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While ProVen says on their site that they have conducted tests
                  on obesity among clients, these are all in house tests.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              They are only available to purchase online, which limits some of
              their customers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ProVen is a very new product in the weight loss market. While some
            other brands have decided to focus solely on weight loss, delivering
            fast and unsustainable results, ProVen has moved away from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have a new approach. ProVen have approached the creation of
            these supplements with a focus on holistic health. These supplements
            are packed full of antioxidants – ingredients that are thought to
            aid the body’s natural detoxification process and improve immune
            system functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of this brand is not to make an overnight transformation
            purely for aesthetic purposes, like some other companies on the
            market right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, ProVen focuses on overall health and weight loss as a part
            of that. Their ingredients don’t just have weight loss benefits, but
            also have benefits in other areas of general health, including
            decreased cholesterol and decreased risk of colds. This brand
            focuses on long term health rather than short term, sometimes
            unhealthy results.

                  Green tea can increase our metabolic rate, which can lead to

          <h2>Lab Testing</h2>
          <p>
            ProVen states that their ingredients and products go through quality
            testing in labs before they are approved and sent to customers. It
            ensures high quality, safe products.
          </p>
          <p>These products have also been FDA certified.</p>
          <p>
            To be FDA certified, a product must be deemed to be more beneficial
            than it is harmful. A product also has to adhere to strict federal
            guidelines on quality standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            ProVen adheres to both of these standards, meaning that customers
            can be assured they are taking safe, high-quality products.
          </p>
          <p>
            ProVen also states that their products have gone through in-house
            testing to make sure they work. A trial was carried out on obese
            patients to chart weight loss, with an average weight loss of 55lbs
            among their 62 participants.
          </p>
          <h2>Shipping</h2>
          <p>
            ProVen ships through FedEx and UPS to ensure fast, reliable
            delivery. They ship 365 days a year and have a speedy delivery
            service. They promise that US customers will receive their orders
            within 1-7 business days of purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            International orders will take a little longer to arrive – you
            should get your order within 7-14 business days. (Remember that this
            depends on customs delays in your country!)
          </p>
          <h2>How Does Proven Work?</h2>
          <p>
            ProVen has shifted away from some of the tactics used by weight loss
            companies. Many companies introduce harmful toxins into the body,
            inducing a laxative effect that can be dangerous to your overall
            health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, ProVen focuses on products that have been shown to have
            benefits to your overall health, including packing their supplements
            full of vitamins and antioxidants.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, antioxidants are an excellent supplement to introduce
            into your diet, as they are known to aid your liver’s natural
            detoxification process.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, one of the ingredients in the ProVen supplements
            is grape seed extract.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grape seed extract has been shown to have beneficial impacts on the
            levels of free radicals in our bodies. These are toxins, and if they
            build up in our bodies, it can have harmful impacts on our livers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grape seed extract has been shown to have some benefits in aiding
            the liver through the detoxification of certain toxic elements from
            the body. It is good for your overall health, as well as the health
            of your vital organs.
          </p>
          <p>
            ProVen’s all-natural products also include the introduction of extra
            fiber into your diet. Fiber is an important aspect of any diet, but
            <a
              href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-i-be-eating-more-fiber-2019022115927#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20American%20adults%20eat,and%2030%20daily%20grams%2C%20respectively."
              >many Americans do not get enough fiber in their daily life.</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Fiber is an important addition to your diet to aid weight loss
            because it helps to slow the digestion process, meaning that we feel
            fuller for longer. It discourages us from overeating, which is one
            of the significant factors in weight gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the addition of extra antioxidants and vitamins into your
            daily diet through ProVen can boost energy levels. The addition of
            caffeine in the form of Green Tea levels can also give a steady
            boost of energy throughout the day.
          </p>
          <h2>How Should You Take ProVen?</h2>
          <p>
            ProVen’s products are easy to consume. They come in a handy tablet
            form and can be taken with a glass of water. Very easy to swallow.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to take 2 pills in the morning after your breakfast. Make
            sure you do not take the pills on empty stomach. And have the pills
            with a glass of water.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also recommended that you drink lots of water while taking
            these pills. Keep yourself hydrated throughout the day.

            Although ProVen doesn’t specifically state who should and should not
            use their products on their website, there are a few groups of
            people who should be cautious before taking this product.
          </p>
          <p>
            These people should consult a doctor before taking these or any
            other supplements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Anyone under eighteen</b>should not take any supplements
              marketed towards weight loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone with a <b>history of eating disorders</b>should not take
              supplements marketed towards weight loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pregnant and breastfeeding women</b>should consult their doctor
              before introducing supplements into their diet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone <b>regularly taking prescription medication</b>should
              consult a doctor to ensure that there will be no ingredients that
              interfere with their medication.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In particular, two known ingredients that may interact with
                  prescription medication are <b>garlic</b> and
                  <b>Asian ginseng.</b>
                </li>

          <h2>ProVen Side Effects</h2>
          <p>
            ProVen adheres to GMP standards. It means they adhere to Good
            Manufacturing Practices, so the high quality of both their
            ingredients and their products is guaranteed. On top of this, ProVen
            is FDA certified.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it should be noted that there are some ingredients that
            could possibly interfere with medications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, in high concentrations, garlic, green tea extract,
            and Ginseng can interact with medications. These ingredients can
            also have side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and headaches,
            depending on the concentration.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When taken in concentrated doses, Green Tea extract might also
              interact with certain drugs, like

              similar to Aspirin.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you are taking any kind of blood thinner regularly, you
                  should make sure you contact your doctor before taking this,
                  as the concentration of
                  <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic">garlic</a>

              >official website</a

            . Although this may limit some of their customers, as some customers
            may prefer to buy products in person rather than online, it does
            have some benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some downsides to selling through third-party sellers –
            including the increased risk of customers mistakenly buying a
            product that they think is genuine but is actually a fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be dangerous to the customer, as there’s no guarantee that
            what they’re consuming is safe. Selling only through ProVen’s
            official website means that customers can be sure they will only
            ever be buying a genuine product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ordinarily, ProVen’s pills retail for $297 a bottle. If this seems
            expensive, you might be happy to hear that there is a serious sale
            currently going on their website. One bottle currently sells on
            their website for $67 – savings of 77%.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re interested in buying, you can increase your savings by
            buying in bulk. A pack of six bottles of ProVen will cost $282 in
            total – or $47 a bottle. It works out to savings of 84% of the
            original price!
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion; Should You Buy This Product?</h2>
          <p>
            It should be stated that no supplement alone causes you to shed
            unwanted weight and relying solely on supplements to achieve weight
            loss goals won’t give you the long-term results that you want. If
            you buy these supplements with that mindset, you may end up being
            disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is promising that ProVen doesn’t promise dramatic
            overnight results like some other brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, when brands promise dramatic weight loss in a matter of
            weeks, their claims are bogus, and customers won’t experience this
            massive decrease in weight. Sometimes they do lose weight but find
            themselves putting it back on very quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also encouraging that this company doesn’t promote very fast
            weight loss, which can often be dangerous. As a reference, people
            should be aiming to lose 1-2lbs a week at maximum, and if a company
            promotes weight loss any faster than that, customers should be wary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that ProVen doesn’t promote these very fast results, and
            instead focuses on slower, long term results is very encouraging as
            a consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, due to the natural ingredients that are all thought to have
            beneficial effects on the body and our overall health, these
            products carry a much lower risk of side effects than other
            supplements.
          </p>
          <p>
            If taken as part of a healthy diet with a good amount of exercise,
            customers may see some beneficial results.
          </p>
          <p>
            These results may not just be in weight loss, but they may also see
            some of the other beneficial results in other areas of their health
            due to the antioxidants and vitamins found in these supplements.
