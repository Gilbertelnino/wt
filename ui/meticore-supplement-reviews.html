              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some weight loss supplements contain ingredients that work as

            <li>
              Meticore does not make outlandish claims about dramatic overnight

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some weight loss companies claim that you can see dramatic
                  weight loss in only a few weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should be very cautious with claims like these because
                  often they claim you can lose dangerous amounts of weight in a
                  short space of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weight-loss like this is unsustainable! You should be focusing
                  on the long term, sustainable changes over time, which will
                  take months.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  While meticore says on their site that they have conducted tests
                  on obesity among clients, these are all in house tests.
                </li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            meticore is a very new product in the weight loss market. While some
            other brands have decided to focus solely on weight loss, delivering
            fast and unsustainable results, meticore has moved away from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have a new approach. meticore have approached the creation of
            these supplements with a focus on holistic health. These supplements
            are packed full of antioxidants – ingredients that are thought to
            aid the body’s natural detoxification process and improve immune
            system functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of this brand is not to make an overnight transformation
            purely for aesthetic purposes, like some other companies on the
            market right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, meticore focuses on overall health and weight loss as a part
            of that. Their ingredients don’t just have weight loss benefits, but
            also have benefits in other areas of general health, including
            decreased cholesterol and decreased risk of colds. This brand
            focuses on long term health rather than short term, sometimes
            unhealthy results.

            market. These ingredients have all been studied regarding their
            benefits to our all-around health. To help you decide whether or not

          </p>
      
          <h2>Lab Testing</h2>
          <p>
            Meticore states that their ingredients and products go through quality
            testing in labs before they are approved and sent to customers. It
            ensures high quality, safe products.

          <p>
            To be FDA certified, a product must be deemed to be more beneficial
            than it is harmful. A product also has to adhere to strict federal
            guidelines on quality standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meticore adheres to both of these standards, meaning that customers

            testing to make sure they work. A trial was carried out on obese
            patients to chart weight loss, with an average weight loss of 55lbs
            among their 62 participants.

          <p>
            Although meticore doesn’t specifically state who should and should not
            use their products on their website, there are a few groups of
            people who should be cautious before taking this product.
          </p>
          <p>
            These people should consult a doctor before taking these or any
            other supplements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Anyone under eighteen</b>should not take any supplements
              marketed towards weight loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone with a <b>history of eating disorders</b>should not take
              supplements marketed towards weight loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pregnant and breastfeeding women</b>should consult their doctor
              before introducing supplements into their diet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone <b>regularly taking prescription medication</b>should
              consult a doctor to ensure that there will be no ingredients that
              interfere with their medication.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In particular, two known ingredients that may interact with
                  prescription medication are <b>garlic</b> and
                  <b>Asian ginseng.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h2>meticore Side Effects</h2>
          <p>
            meticore adheres to GMP standards. It means they adhere to Good
            Manufacturing Practices, so the high quality of both their
            ingredients and their products is guaranteed. On top of this, meticore
            is FDA certified.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it should be noted that there are some ingredients that
            could possibly interfere with medications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, in high concentrations, garlic, green tea extract,
            and Ginseng can interact with medications. These ingredients can
            also have side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and headaches,
            depending on the concentration.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When taken in concentrated doses, Green Tea extract might also
              interact with certain drugs, like
              <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/green-tea"
                >Beta-Blockers</a

            </li>
            <li>
              In high concentrations, garlic can act like a blood thinner,
              similar to Aspirin.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you are taking any kind of blood thinner regularly, you
                  should make sure you contact your doctor before taking this,
                  as the concentration of

            </li>
            <li>
              In some cases, Ginseng can interfere with drugs like

            Meticore products can only be purchased from their

              >official website</a

            . Although this may limit some of their customers, as some customers
            may prefer to buy products in person rather than online, it does
            have some benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some downsides to selling through third-party sellers –
            including the increased risk of customers mistakenly buying a
            product that they think is genuine but is actually a fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be dangerous to the customer, as there’s no guarantee that
            what they’re consuming is safe. Selling only through Meticore’s
            official website means that customers can be sure they will only
            ever be buying a genuine product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ordinarily, Meticore’s pills retail for $297 a bottle. If this seems
            expensive, you might be happy to hear that there is a serious sale
            currently going on their website. One bottle currently sells on
            their website for $67 – savings of 77%.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re interested in buying, you can increase your savings by
            buying in bulk. A pack of six bottles of Meticore will cost $282 in
            total – or $47 a bottle. It works out to savings of 84% of the
            original price!
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion; Should You Buy This Product?</h2>
          <p>
            It should be stated that no supplement alone causes you to shed
            unwanted weight and relying solely on supplements to achieve weight
            loss goals won’t give you the long-term results that you want. If
            you buy these supplements with that mindset, you may end up being
            disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is promising that Meticore doesn’t promise dramatic
            overnight results like some other brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often, when brands promise dramatic weight loss in a matter of
            weeks, their claims are bogus, and customers won’t experience this
            massive decrease in weight. Sometimes they do lose weight but find
            themselves putting it back on very quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also encouraging that this company doesn’t promote very fast
            weight loss, which can often be dangerous. As a reference, people
            should be aiming to lose 1-2lbs a week at maximum, and if a company
            promotes weight loss any faster than that, customers should be wary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that meticore doesn’t promote these very fast results, and
            instead focuses on slower, long term results is very encouraging as
            a consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, due to the natural ingredients that are all thought to have
            beneficial effects on the body and our overall health, these
            products carry a much lower risk of side effects than other
            supplements.
